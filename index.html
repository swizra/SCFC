          <p class="lead">
            SCFC was founded by students who wanted more than theoretical
            knowledge. We believe the best way to learn is by doing, and we're
            building a community where ambitious students can gain real
            consulting experience while creating tangible value for businesses.
            Our values reflect what matters most to us.
